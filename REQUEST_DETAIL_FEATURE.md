# Request Detail Feature

## Overview

Successfully implemented clickable requests that navigate to individual request detail pages. Users can now click on any request in the table or card view to view detailed information about that specific request.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Request Detail Page (`src/pages/RequestDetail.tsx`)
- **Complete request information display**: Shows all request details including title, description, type, priority, status, and contact information
- **Action buttons**: Complete and cancel request functionality with proper permissions
- **Timeline view**: Shows the history of the request (created, completed, cancelled)
- **Contact information**: Displays the requester's details
- **Responsive design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading states**: Skeleton loading while data is being fetched
- **Error handling**: Proper error states for missing or inaccessible requests

### 2. Routing Configuration (`src/App.tsx`)
- **New route**: Added `/requests/:id` route that renders the RequestDetail component
- **Proper route ordering**: Placed before booking routes to avoid conflicts

### 3. Clickable Table View (`src/components/home/RequestTableView.tsx`)
- **Row clickability**: Entire table rows are now clickable and navigate to request detail
- **Hover effects**: Visual feedback when hovering over rows
- **Action button isolation**: Action buttons (complete/cancel) don't trigger row navigation
- **Event propagation**: Proper event handling to prevent conflicts

### 4. Clickable Card View (`src/components/home/RequestCardView.tsx`)
- **Card clickability**: Entire cards are now clickable and navigate to request detail
- **Hover effects**: Enhanced hover effects for better UX
- **Action button isolation**: Action buttons don't trigger card navigation
- **Event propagation**: Proper event handling to prevent conflicts

### 5. Translation Support
- **New translation keys**: Added comprehensive translation keys for the request detail page
- **Multi-language support**: All new text is translatable
- **Consistent terminology**: Uses the same translation patterns as existing components
